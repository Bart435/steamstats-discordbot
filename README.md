# steam-checker-bot

This project isn't that big, However it can be usefull in some cases. I created and maintained this project during class. What can i say, It's boring. 
It's writen to use the current discord v14 package, It converts profile url's into steam64 id's. And fetches steam information / stat's by steam64 id.
Easily modifyable if you have any experience with javascript. 
If you request something to be added, I will most likely add it.
